With an *Armature* in *Pose* mode, you'll find a *Duik* section in the `Pose` menu of the *3D View*, which contains the rigging tools available.

All these tools are bits of auto-rigs, and create nice controls.

The controllers are renamed with the ".Ctrl" suffix to make them easy to find.

These tools create some other bones needed for the rig, but the ones you'll need to influence your mesh objects are always the ones you've created yourself before using these tools, located by default in the 8th layer.

You can change the layers used by Duik in the [settings](settings.md) of the add-on.
