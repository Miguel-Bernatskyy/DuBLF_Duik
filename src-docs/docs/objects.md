## Camera Linker

`Properties Panel ‣ Object Tab ‣ Duik Camera Linker`

![](img/cam_linker.png)

With the camera linker, you can keep a list of properties which have to target the current scene camera, even if this camera changes. For example, you can link the target of a *Track To* constraint to the scene camera.

All the properties listed there will automatically be updated if the current scene camera changes.

Just copy the path of the property and paste it in the camera linker list.
