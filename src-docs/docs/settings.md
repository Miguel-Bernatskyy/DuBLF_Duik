## Layers

The bones are automatically sorted in layers to keep things tidy.

The bones used as controllers are in the first layer by default, the bones with influences (which are *skinned*) are in the 8th, and the all the other bones, used by the constraints, are in the 24th layer. You can change this the way yuou prefer in the preferences.

## Pie Menus

You can use a nice pie menu to quickly access the (auto)rigging tools using the [SHIFT]+[D] keyboard shortcut.

If you'd prefer not to have this pie menu and keep this shortcut for something else, you can de-activate it in these settings.
