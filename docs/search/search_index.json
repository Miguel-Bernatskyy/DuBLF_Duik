Duik is originally a comprehensive animation and rigging toolset for Adobe After Effects . It all began as a joke\u2026 When will Duik be available for Blender ? Duik for Blender aims to reproduce the rigging process developped in After Effects but in blender, with predefined Armatures and bones for limbs or complete characters and a comprehensive yet easy to animate auto-rig, along with some advanced rigging and animation tools for experts. It is in an early phase of the development , but it may already be useful for 3D riggers. Rigging is already very nice natively in Blender , but there are always some automations that can be done to make your process faster and easier. Introduction The first tools which have been developped are some bits of automations for creating nice controllers for very common techniques in 3D rigging, like animatable IK/FK (with bend and stretch controls), FK controllers, intuitive bendy-bone controllers, and some nice UI components\u2026 The goal is to add more low-level tools first, and then build upon them to have nice auto-rigs and animation tools, both for 3D and 2D cut-out animation. 3D Blender already includes an auto-rig add-on called Rigify but it\u2019s a tool which only rigs complete characters at once. Sometimes it\u2019s better to be able to customize a lot the character and to have some low-level tools too, more modular. Another issue with rigify is that the rigs it creates may be too complex for animators, as there are a lot of unnecessary controls, or at least controls which should be deactivated or hidden by default. This can be a big issue for animators; character rigs have to stay intuitive, easy-to-use and with as few main controls as possible, hiding less useful controls for details. Duik for Blender tries to address these issues by using a modular system, with low, mid and high-level tools. Low-level tools are more advanced and modular, as high-level tools are pretty standard auto-rigs for limbs or complete characters. The rigs created by Duik have all controls needed for a perfect animation (there are no compromise on usability), but always built with a priority on intuitivity and easiness (controls are sorted out based on their importance, there are no unnecessary control). For now, Duik for Blender only includes low-level tools for controllers creation, which will be used to build high-level auto-rigs. The first goal for the upcoming versions of Duik for Blender , is to build robust, useful, and modular tools for advanced and professionnal riggers. Another goal for future development of Duik for Blender is to make it easy to use for beginners with automatic tools and auto-rigs working the same way as Duik for After Effects , with the same process (Armature -> Autorig -> Details). 2D (Cut-out) The other important goal for the development of Duik for Blender is to develop a way to quickly and easily rig cut-out characters, with or without deformations, exactly the same way as in After Effects . This would make the animation step with this style of animation really easier and quicker than in After Effects, thanks to the performance of Blender . Then, Duik could ease the process of exporting or rendering the character and its animation from Blender to import in After Effects for compositing. One could even imagine that characters could be rigged either in After Effects or in Blender, and animated in both, with Duik developped for both softwares. Plans There\u2019s no precise schedule to develop all of this yet, as the only revenue for these development (and the support of the tools, the maintainment of the website, etc) is what Duduf (the developper) gets on Patreon , and this is going to be a huge work. But, step by step, we\u2019ll see how it goes. Maybe after building a few more tools it could be time for a crowdfunding campaign. But absolutely nothing\u2019s sure yet, these are just assumptions!

For example, this can be used to switch different mouth shapes for a very cartoonish render where mouthes of the characters are drawn in 2D in another software. It\u2019s also an easy way to animate a frame sequence with a precise control, not just playing it at a specific frame rate. Note This could be achieved using actual frame sequences and a scripted driver on the offset property, but this tool fixes three issues: With frame sequences, each frame is not kept in memory, and this has a bad impact on the playback performance in the viewport when textures are displayed. This is not an issue with the way Duik handles this Texture Animation tool. On the contrary to frame sequences, you can animate the actual list of images, and not a number corresponding to a frame. This is a lot easier to select specific images/frames instead of having to remember their numbers. This Texture Animation tool allows you to select individual images, which may not be numbered, named the same way or even not stored in the same folder. The Duik TexAnim section appears in the sidebar of the Shader Editor when an Image Texture node is selected. There you can use the + and - buttons to add and remove images, and change their order. The Current image property shows the number of the selected image and you can choose a name for this specific TexAnim . You can use the Copy control to active object and Remove control from active object buttons to add or remove a copy of the list in the sidebar of the 3D View (N), when the active object is selected. This is a nice way to expose the list to make it more accessible for animation. This list can be keyframed . Tip If the active object is a bone in Pose mode, the list is displayed only when this bone is selected, not the whole armature. Out of the Pose mode, the list is linked to the armature object and not any specific bone. Hint The list is actually linked to the node in the shader, not any object. This means the keyframes are shown by default in the dope sheet and graph editor only when the node is selected. Deselect the \u201c Only Selected \u201d option to see these keyframes even when the shader editor is closed, and use the filters (especially the collection filter) to better sort all the keyframes.
